        "full_content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) in the AI race.\n\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\n\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors, to power its AI software.\n\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta (META) to run its AI products, according to The Information.\n\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion. It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\n\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\n\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\n\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search."

        "summary": "Vanguard thinks the 60/40 portfolio should be flipped. Retirement experts weigh in.",
        "publisher": "Yahoo Finance",
        "full_content": "Vanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\n\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\n\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\n\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\n\nVanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\n\nMany retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\n\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\n\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said."

        "publisher": "Motley Fool",
        "full_content": "A $10,000 Verizon investment in 2015 would be worth just $14,650 today, badly trailing the S&P 500.\n\nThe same investment made in 2005 grew to $27,400 by 2015, beating the market.\n\nThe stock may suit dividend-focused income investors, but long-term growth seekers should look elsewhere.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Verizon Communications ›\n\nBear with me for a second; I'd like to start this overview with a quick history lesson.\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) was a hot tamale in 2015. The telecom giant was on a hot streak in the early days of the smartphone era. If you had invested $10,000 in Verizon stock near the end of 2005, activated the dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), and left it alone for the next 10 years, you'd have a market-beating $27,400 in your pocket.\n\nBut the smartphone frenzy slowed down over the years, though Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to build one of the world's largest market caps around the iPhone.\n\nVerizon's soaring sales growth cooled off. Smaller rival T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) stole millions of Verizon's mobile subscribers. The company continued to generate impressive cash flows despite several rounds of expensive network infrastructure upgrades.\n\nBut the old magic was gone. If you started a new $10,000 Verizon investment on Dec. 22, 2015, you'd have $4,650 in total returns today for a total value of $14,650. That's better than sticking the cash under your pillow for a decade, but far behind the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) posting a $40,220 total-return value over the same span.\n\nVerizon remains a solid dividend stock, fueled by generous cash flows. The dividend yield stands at 6.9% today -- one of the 10 highest yields in the S&P 500.\n\nTherefore, the stock may make sense for dividend-hungry income investors, but it seems unable to maintain its value over the long haul. Perhaps I'll change my tune in a couple of decades, as retirement approaches, but I'm not buying Verizon stock today. At this rate, I'm not even sure that Verizon will be a leading telecom competitor in 20 years (or even 10).\n\nBefore you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,239!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,159,896!*"

        "full_content": "In December 2025, Apple announced iOS changes in Japan and agreed to open iOS in Brazil, allowing alternative app marketplaces and payment options while adding new safeguards to address privacy and security concerns.\n\nThese regulatory-driven openings, combined with Apple’s push into advanced AI like its SHARP 3D imaging model, highlight a gradual shift toward a more software- and services-centric ecosystem under tighter global oversight.\n\nNext, we’ll examine how Apple’s move to support alternative app marketplaces, while emphasizing security, affects the company’s existing investment narrative.\n\nRare earth metals are the new gold rush. Find out which 37 stocks are leading the charge.\n\nTo own Apple, you need to believe its ecosystem can keep turning a mature iPhone base into steadily growing, high‑margin services and software income. The biggest near term catalyst is how effectively Apple layers AI features like SHARP 3D imaging across hardware and services, while the key risk is mounting regulatory pressure on its App Store model. The new iOS openings in Japan and Brazil appear meaningful symbolically but do not yet transform the overall investment case.\n\nThe Brazilian settlement that opens iOS to third party app stores and alternative payments sits at the heart of that risk. It directly touches Apple’s most profitable Services revenue stream while testing whether the company can defend its security and privacy pitch as regulators push for more competition. How Apple balances compliance with preserving App Store economics will be central to how investors assess its next phase of AI and services driven growth.\n\nYet behind the AI headlines, investors should be aware that escalating app store regulation could...\n\nRead the full narrative on Apple (it's free!)\n\nApple's narrative projects $477.4 billion revenue and $133.6 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 5.3% yearly revenue growth and about a $34.3 billion earnings increase from $99.3 billion today.\n\nUncover how Apple's forecasts yield a $286.58 fair value, a 5% upside to its current price.\n\n121 members of the Simply Wall St Community currently see Apple’s fair value between US$175 and US$309, highlighting very different expectations. Set against tightening global app store regulation, those differing views show why it is worth comparing several independent takes on Apple’s long term earnings power and resilience.\n\nExplore 121 other fair value estimates on Apple - why the stock might be worth 36% less than the current price!"

        "full_content": "This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.\n\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 24, 2025. This post recaps the market day after the abbreviated holiday session.\n\nThe U.S. market is now closed. The market is shut early for Christmas Eve, but it still managed to hand bulls one more present ahead of the holiday: green, green, green.\n\nThe Dow (+0.60%) led among major indexes as 28 of the index's 30 components rose today; one declined and one was flat. Nike Inc. (+5.1%) saw the largest strides as Apple CEO Tim Cook bought shares in the beleaguered footwear giant. The index set a new record today at 48,731.16.\n\nThe S&P 500(+0.32%) set a record close of its own, closing out the market at 6,932.05. Only 111 of the index's components were in decline today, with a wide variety of firms pitching in to lift the index -- and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.22%).\n\nRounding out the pack, the Russell 2000 (+0.20%) closed out the day by reversing some of yesterday's declines. The small cap index fell yesterday amid worries that fast GDP growth could derail hopes for the Fed's 2026 rate cuts.\n\nThe market will be shut tomorrow to observe Christmas Day. However, here are some of the more consequential events and insights that marked today's abbreviated trading session:\n\nAmong firms with at least a $2 billion market cap, Edgewise Therapeutics (+25.2%) was the best-performing stock on the U.S. markets today, lifted by news that it completed a phase two trial for its clinical-stage heart disease drug. It was joined by a field of healthcare and technology names, including Travere Therapeutics (+13.9%), UiPath (+7.5%), and others.\n\nOn the other end of the market, some of the excesses of the retail trade fell back to Earth on Wednesday. AST SpaceMobile (-8.6%), Hycroft Mining (-8%), and D-Wave Quantum (-5.5%) led up a list of equities which have made our midday movers list in recent days, largely due to a bump in excitement around space, mining, quantum computing, and other popular trades.\n\nBefore peacing out for the Christmas holiday, investors were also treated to a small handful of economic readouts to close out the week in data.\n\nChief among them were jobless claims for last week. They were bifurcated, as they have been as of late: While initial claims declined (+214K, down from +224K in the previous week), continuing claims rose (+1.923 million, up from +1.885 million)."

        "publisher": "Motley Fool",
        "full_content": "Tech stocks have performed well in 2025, and Apple has benefited from this broader rally, thanks to the strong demand for its latest iPhones and the improving services business.\n\nApple's top-line growth is poised to accelerate in 2026.\n\nA massive installed base of users on older iPhones can help Apple outgrow the broader smartphone market in the new year.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTechnology stocks have delivered a resilient performance in 2025, which is evident from the 21% jump in the Nasdaq Composite index this year as of this writing. I call the sector's performance resilient because tech stocks have been under stress at certain times this year owing to various factors.\n\nFrom the potential fallout of the Trump administration's tariffs to concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending turning into a bubble, there have been times when investors have panicked and hit the sell button. However, the strong growth that tech companies have been reporting this year has helped them overcome the negatives.\n\nThe good part is that the strong spending on AI infrastructure is set to drive the stock market higher over the next couple of years. According to JPMorgan, the S&P 500 index's average earnings growth could be between 13% and 15% for \"at least the next two years,\" thanks to the \"AI supercycle.\" As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nasdaq stocks jumping higher in the new year.\n\nHere's a closer look at an important Nasdaq stock that can ride the broader market's rally and deliver solid gains to investors.\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has rallied impressively in recent months, jumping 58% since hitting a 52-week low in the first week of April. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's impressive rise can be attributed to the healthy demand for its latest iPhones and the improving traction of the services business.\n\nApple ended its latest fiscal year 2025 (ended on Sept. 27) with $416.1 billion in revenue, up by 6.4% from the prior year. Earnings increased by 23% from the prior year to $7.46 per share. Analysts are expecting its top-line growth to accelerate to almost 9% in the current fiscal year to just over $453.1 billion.\n\nYou may be surprised to see that analysts are upbeat about Apple's prospects in a year when the high cost of smartphone memory chips is likely to weigh on the industry. Memory manufacturers are scrambling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips deployed in data centers, which is why they are allocating more capacity to this niche."

        "publisher": "Yahoo Finance",
        "full_content": "The artificial intelligence boom isn't cooling off — it's getting bigger, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya contends.\n\nWhile AI skeptics have pointed to eye-popping valuations as a reason to run, Arya said the industry is only at the \"midpoint\" of a decade-long transformation, and it's being led by Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO).\n\nIn a report titled \"2026 Year Ahead: choppy, still cheerful,\" Arya forecast a 30% year-over-year surge in global semiconductor sales that will finally push the sector past a historic $1 trillion annual sales milestone in 2026.\n\nArya noted a strong belief in companies with \"moats that are quantified by their margin structure.\" In addition to Nvidia and Broadcom, he highlighted four other large-cap semiconductor companies — Lam Research (LRCX), KLA (KLAC), Analog Devices (ADI), and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) — as his top picks for 2026.\n\n\"I often say that investing in semis is very simple,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call. \"You don't need any sell-side analyst to do that. Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\n\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\n\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?\n\nRead more: How to protect your portfolio from an AI bubble\n\nArya remained optimistic, arguing that current spending is both \"offensive and defensive.\" In other words, Big Tech has no choice but to invest to protect its existing empires.\n\nNvidia — the world's largest company by market cap — is currently operating in a \"different galaxy,\" Arya said.\n\nWith Nvidia shares up over 40% year to date, Arya warned against comparing the AI leader to traditional chipmakers. While the average chip is priced at $2.40, an Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) sells for roughly $30,000.\n\nAnd although some fear Nvidia's market cap has hit a ceiling, BofA pointed to free cash flow — projected to hit half a trillion dollars over the next three years — and a valuation that is \"still incredibly cheap\" when adjusted for growth."
